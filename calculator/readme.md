# Calculator Challenge

Your challenge is to build a browser based calculator using javascript! It will use alerts and prompts, as well as variables and logical statements to produce the correct answer. 

We have included an example of how to use alerts and prompts usefully to get you started. The aim is to allow a user to type two numbers and an operator, and to return the result of the mathematical statement.

Your calculator should be able to handle addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Bon chance!

## Extension!

As an extension, you can also equip your calculator to do numbers to the power of others, and square roots.

## Extension++

As a final extension, your calculator should be refactored so the entire app is now wrapped inside functions.
